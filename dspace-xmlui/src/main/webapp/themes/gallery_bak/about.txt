    <h2>About the Gallery Theme</h2>

    <p>The image zoomer is modifiable. To do so, mouse over the image such that the image zoom rectangle appears, then:
    <ul>
        <li>To Zoom IN: left mouse click and move mouse UP</li>
        <li>To Zoom OUT: left mouse click and move mouse DOWN</li>
        <li>To enlarge the zoom box: left mouse click and move mouse RIGHT</li>
        <li>To shrink the zoom box: left mouse click and move mouse LEFT</li>


    <p>This Manakin theme provides a gallery display for image collections. It assumes DSpace items
        in the collection have a DSpace-generated thumbnail, and it displays details and the
        thumbail in embedded popups in the gallery interface. </p>

    <p> In addition, it implements a Javascript-based zoom and pan interface on the DSpace item
        detail view. See instructions. </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

    <p>Install as any other Manakin theme. This theme contains no aspects, so can be added without
        recompiling/building DSpace</p>

    <p>All configuration paramaters are set in the file "config.xml" located at the root of the
       theme when unpacked. Locating them there is intended ease migration 
       to new versions of this theme.</p>

	<p>Larger thumbnail images are
        recommended, as they will display in the popup interface at a larger size.</p>

    <p><strong>Zoom and pan interface</strong></p>

    <p>
        The Javascript-based zoom and pan interface is implemented using TJP Zoom (see Credits and
        License Info). This interface will appear if the DSpace item in this collection has a
        bitstream of MIMETYPE JPEG that is less than the value set in <em>config-maxServiceImageSize</em>.
        If the item has multiple JPEGs that qualify, the LARGEST will be discplayed in the zoom tool.</p>
